# Climate Analysis with SQLAlchemy

Welcome! 

This project uses Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis, data exploration, and visualization of a climate database. All of the  analysis was completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. After completing the initial analysis, a Flask API is designed based on the queries developed.

The `climate.ipynb` file performs the climate analysis. In the Resources folder, you will find the CSV files used to create the database, the sqlite file used as the database file, and the python file to set up the database and Flask app. 

You can launch this Jupyter Notebook from your Python environment. A local host is needed to view the Flask app.

Notes:

This project is still a work in progress, as I continue to develop queries and visualizations. Placeholder comments or commented-code may be present.
