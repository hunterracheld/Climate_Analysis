# Climate Analysis with SQLAlchemy

This project uses Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis, data exploration, and visualization of my climate database. All of the  analysis was completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

`climate.ipynb` shows my code for generating this analysis. You can launch this Jupyter Notebook from your Python environment. 

After completing the initial analysis, a Flask API is designed based on the queries developed.

Notes:

1. I used the starter code, which had instructions for the bonuses below. I did not complete all of them. So the bottom half contains starter code, which I intend to go back to later.

2. My python file is in the resources folder along with the sql files.
